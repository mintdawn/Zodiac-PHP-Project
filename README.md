# Zodiac PHP Project

# Description
This is a small project I did to help me practice working with forms and PHP. It is part of my overall portfolio. It is not the most complex program but, I did it myself and it shows my skills with this language at this point in time. This program displays your astrological information depending on when you were born. If you are just starting out with PHP and need help understanding forms and switch cases this might help you learn.

# Usage
Browse to the index.php with a web browser and enter your name and choose a birth range. The program should display your astrological information.

# Known Issues
It could be more responsive. When viewed on a phone the website is a little short for the view port and the form and text are small. So this is something I might work on or others can work on if they use this for themselves. This was created on a desktop.
